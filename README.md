# Steps to reproduce

Install dependencies and build the project:

1. `pnpm i`
1. `pnpm build`

`pnpm preview` works as expected, but the types of `astro:db` in [`db/seeds`](./db/seed.ts) are not working properly.

```ts
import { db, Comment } from "astro:db";
              ^ Module '"astro:db"' has no exported member 'Comment'.deno-ts(2305)
```

The types for `Comment` are generated by Astro and can be found in [`.astro/db-types.d.ts`](./.astro/db-types.d.ts)

In [`.vscode/settings.json`](./.vscode/settings.json) if you change `"deno.enable": true,` to false it will work fine with Node.
